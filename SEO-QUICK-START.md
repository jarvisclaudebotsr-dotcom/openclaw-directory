🚀 Excited to launch OpenClaw Directory!

A searchable directory of 100+ skills for Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenClaw agents.

One-click install. Open source. Community-driven.

Check it out: https://openclawdirectory.ai

🧵 Here's why this matters...

1/ AI agents are powerful, but discovering good skills is hard.

GitHub awesome lists are great, but they're static. No search, no categories, no install instructions.

2/ We built a proper directory:
- Search across 100+ skills
- Browse by category
- One command to install: `clawdhub install skill-name`
- Submit your own skills

3/ Why it's better:
✅ Cross-platform (Claude, Cursor, Clawdbot, OpenClaw)
✅ Dynamic search & filtering
✅ GitHub integration
✅ Community submissions
✅ 100% free & open source

4/ Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind, Supabase.

Deployed on Vercel. Sub-1s page loads.

SSG for every skill page = great SEO.

5/ Looking for feedback!

What categories are missing?
What skills should we feature?
